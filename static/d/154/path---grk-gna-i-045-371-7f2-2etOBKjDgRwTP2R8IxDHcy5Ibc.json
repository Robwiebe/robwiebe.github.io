Romans reveals that God has won the victory over sin and death through Jesus, who paid the penalty by dying in our place. He broke sin’s enslaving power over us. Through God’s power, Christians can reflect the attitudes and actions of those who are deeply loved by God. A prayerful study of Romans will uncover the key to the Spirit-filled life: a simple and ongoing response of faith in Jesus and his work on the cross. Be prepared! Martin Luther, John Wesley, and many other notable persons of faith found their lives transformed by the message of this book.

After a brief introduction, Paul declares that all humans, regardless of background or nationality, are sinners and thus are not able to have a relationship with God (Rom 1:18-3:20). Next he explains how God justly dealt with sin, making the divine-human friendship possible (Rom 3:21-8:39). Paul then argues that our faith in response to God’s work through the cross is the key for our justification (salvation) and continues to be the way to gain access to the power of the indwelling Christ in order to say no to sin and yes to God. In chapters 9-11 Paul summarizes how God’s redemptive work through history has prepared a way for the Jews as well as for people of every other nation (Gentiles) to benefit from his gift of grace through Jesus’ death on the cross.

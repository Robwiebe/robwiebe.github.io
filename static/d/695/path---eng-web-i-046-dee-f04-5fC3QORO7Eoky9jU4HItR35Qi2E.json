You’re about to encounter God’s perspective on some hot topics.

Watch how he skillfully strives to wake them up to the fact that they are the dwelling place of the Holy Spirit (1Co 3:16; 6:19). Look for the obvious emotions that filled Paul’s heart as he wrote this letter. You will observe a wide range of moods expressed here, from anger to shame to sorrow to tenderness. He longs for believers to adjust their behavior to reflect the righteousness of Jesus. Paul’s words correct jealousies and pride, steering people away from extremes that undermine Christian unity and love. This book deserves repeated readings. Your time will be well spent as you examine areas in your own life where you may need to make a change."}],"object":"text"}],"object":"block","type":"speech"},{"nodes":[{"leaves":[{"object":"leaf","text":""}],"object":"text"}],"object":"block","type":"speech"},{"nodes":[{"leaves":[{"object":"leaf","text":"Who wrote this book and when?"}],"object":"text"}],"object":"block","type":"subtitle"},{"nodes":[{"leaves":[{"object":"leaf","text":"The apostle Paul wrote it about "},{"marks":[{"object":"mark","type":"smallcaps"}],"object":"leaf","text":"ad"},{"object":"leaf","text":" 54 or 55."}],"object":"text"}],"object":"block","type":"speech"},{"nodes":[{"leaves":[{"object":"leaf","text":""}],"object":"text"}],"object":"block","type":"speech"},{"nodes":[{"leaves":[{"object":"leaf","text":"To whom was it written?"}],"object":"text"}],"object":"block","type":"subtitle"},{"nodes":[{"leaves":[{"object":"leaf","text":"Christians in Corinth, an important commercial city in Greece."}],"object":"text"}],"object":"block","type":"speech"},{"nodes":[{"leaves":[{"object":"leaf","text":""}],"object":"text"}],"object":"block","type":"speech"},{"nodes":[{"leaves":[{"object":"leaf","text":"Why was it written?"}],"object":"text"}],"object":"block","type":"subtitle"},{"nodes":[{"leaves":[{"object":"leaf","text":"Two or three years after leaving the church he’d started in Corinth, Paul heard disturbing reports: Strife and division were seriously threatening the young church.
